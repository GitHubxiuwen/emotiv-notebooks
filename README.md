IPython Notebooks with EPOC Emotiv experiments

#Installation
- Install the SDK using the `sh libs/sdk/EmotivResearchEdition_v2.0.0.20_Install.sh` (or maybe `sudo sh` not sure)
- Both the .sh and .py were modified, don't use .py by itself
- Use https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/ as it's easier to setup ipython notebook that way
- `pip -r libs/requirements.txt` to install the python-emotiv from it's github repo (**use the anaconda's pip**)
